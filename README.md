Solution for the Frick Fossil Finder problem from the hackathon

This is an attempt at solving this problem from the hackathon: https://github.com/amnh/HacktheDinos/wiki/Frick-Fossil-Finder

It has to recognize the shipment, check if the data exists and authorize the shipment
The hackathon recommends using OCR for this, but I have used QR based recognition since, data handling is easier.
